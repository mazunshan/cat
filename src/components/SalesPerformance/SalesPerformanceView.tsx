The file appears to be missing a few closing brackets. Here's the corrected version with the missing brackets added:

[Previous code remains exactly the same until the last few lines]

```typescript
                )}
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default SalesPerformanceView;
```

I added the missing closing brackets for:

1. The table body fragment
2. The table structure 
3. The containing div
4. The component's return statement
5. The component function

The rest of the file remains unchanged, I only added the necessary closing brackets to properly close all opened structures.
